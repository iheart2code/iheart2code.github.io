Currently, I develop in Objective-C on a daily basis, but I am fairly adaptable when it comes to languages and technologies. I have a working knowledge of development for iOS, Android, web, and some back-end technologies.

More than any specific technology, I most excel at learning and becoming productive within a production timeline. I have evolved my skillset over the years as needed, and have worn many different hats over my career: webmaster, Flash prototype developer, iOS developer, SDK architect, and Android developer.

My interests currently lie in the consumer technology and connected home areas.

**Mobile** - I have been working with iOS since [version 1.0](http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Open-Application-Development-Applications/dp/B008SM0XNQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425362994&sr=8-1&keywords=iPhone+Open+Application+Development) in 2008, and have a deep understanding of app development for iOS. My experiences with Android are fairly recent, but I have a good working knowledge of the platform. My most recent successes in the mobile area include [Connect SDK](/work/2014/mobile-sdk-architecture-implementation.html) (iOS, Android, &amp; JavaScript) and [Reach](http://www.iwantreach.com/) (Android).

**Web** - Although my career is rooted in web, I haven't been a web developer by trade since 2007. That hasn't stopped me from taking on miscellaneous tasks &amp; personal projects in the mean time. I have been productive in the last year working in vanilla JavaScript, Angular, Node, webOS &amp; Enyo, and Polymer. My most recent web project is this [portfolio site](https://github.com/iheart2code/iheart2code.github.io).

**Devops** - While I wouldn't seek out a job in Devops, I am very comfortable navigating server environments. Supporting roles in each of my current &amp; past positions have included some form of server administration (web hosting, database design &amp; management, continuous integration setup, issue tracking, app deployment, version control, automated backups).
