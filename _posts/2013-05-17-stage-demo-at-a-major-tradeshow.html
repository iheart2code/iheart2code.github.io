<p>This was a stage demo for the CTO of Cisco, Padmasree Warrior for Cisco Live! 2013 tradeshow. The content matter was extremely technical and needed to be able to pass the sniff-test of various levels of engineering talent present at the show.</p>
<p>This project uses a single laptop to demonstrate a highly technical back-end platform that Cisco has to offer. It also uses an iPad to show what is happening in the network at a high-level with Cisco's platform. Attention to detail was key, as the content of these two demos were moving targets leading up to the week of the show.</p>
<p>The video below contains the full content of the demo from start to finish. This project was later converted into a single deliverable kit form for distribution to various sales teams.</p>
<p>Technologies: Adobe Flash, ActionScript 3, iOS</p>
