## Overview

Led architecture &amp; implementation of normalized, cross-platform, multi-protocol SDK for second screen devices called [Connect SDK](http://www.connectsdk.com/).

Connect SDK is an open source framework that connects your mobile apps with multiple TV platforms. Because most TV platforms support a variety of protocols, Connect SDK integrates and abstracts the discovery and connectivity between all supported protocols.

## Technologies

### Languages
Objective-C, Android, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, WebSockets, BSD Sockets

### Platforms
webOS, SSDP, DLNA, DIAL, Netcast, UDAP, AirPlay, Chromecast (Cast SDK), Samsung Multiscreen SDK, Roku

## Roles &amp; responsibilities

- Lead SDK Engineer, iOS &amp; Android
- Lead architecture planning for Connect SDK
- Implemented iOS SDK
- Oversaw development of Android SDK
- Developer evangelism &amp; support
- Partner support
- Generate quick POCs &amp; support ad hoc demos to stakeholders, business teams, &amp; executives
- Demo support for tradeshows (CES 2014, AppsWorld 2014)
- Documentation, tutorials, Q&amp;A

## Press coverage

"The idea is simple: if it's just as much work to include LG's streaming tools as, say, Chromecast's, you may as well use LG's because they support (nearly) everything."

"&#8230;developers now have to include only one set of code in their apps, whereas they previously had to build custom implementations for each and every device."

"&#8230;developers will take advantage of all of these features by inserting just one line of code into their apps and developers will not have to learn the different APIs for every platform."
