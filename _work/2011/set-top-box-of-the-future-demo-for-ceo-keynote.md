## Overview
This was a high stakes, short deadline stage demo for a high-profile crowd. The work was done at the behest of Cisco's CEO John Chambers for presentation at his CES keynote in 2011.

This project uses HD displays, web cameras, and video, as well as an arrangement of mobile devices to illustrate the future's seamless video experience.

The team worked with many different contacts at Cisco to ensure the design and user experience matched actual Cisco products in various stages of development from concept to release. We also strove to replicate native experiences for iOS and Android within a completely self-contained demo environment.
