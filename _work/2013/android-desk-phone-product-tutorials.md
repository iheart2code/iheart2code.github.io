This project was acquired from the product team responsible for the launch of the Cisco DX600 Series desk phone. It resulted in the release of seven videos meant to instruct new users on the use of the phone's features.

Each of the videos below represent the sections I was responsible for animating and exporting. Each video is a self-contained, self-running Flash executable embedded with a function to step through each frame and export to a PNG sequence and accompanying WAV audio file with voiceover.
