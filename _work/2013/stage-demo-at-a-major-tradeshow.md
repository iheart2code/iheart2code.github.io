## Overview

This was a stage demo for the CTO of Cisco, Padmasree Warrior for Cisco Live! 2013 tradeshow. The content matter was extremely technical and needed to be able to pass the sniff-test of various levels of engineering talent present at the show.

This project uses a single laptop to demonstrate a highly technical back-end platform that Cisco has to offer. It also uses an iPad to show what is happening in the network at a high-level with Cisco's platform. Attention to detail was key, as the content of these two demos were moving targets leading up to the week of the show.

The video below contains the full content of the demo from start to finish. This project was later converted into a single deliverable kit form for distribution to various sales teams.
