Developed front-facing corporate website to spec from designers. Had a hand in conceiving of user interactions/experience, as well as animations. Ensured a consistent experience across different browsers, operating systems, device types, and screen sizes. Worked with 3rd party libraries for best animation &amp; multimedia support available.
